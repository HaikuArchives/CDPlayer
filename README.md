CDPlayer
=================
**This is (probably) not the CDPlayer you're looking for.**

This CDPlayer basically acts as a "remote": it controls the playback functionality that some CD drives in computers have. Since not many modern CD drives support this, CDPlayer was removed from Haiku's source tree and migrated here.
